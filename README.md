# DAG3_Sleeping

[Sleep_analysis.R](https://github.com/Cathie-Wu/DAG3_Sleeping/blob/main/Sleep_analysis.R)

To answer:

1. Which **phenotype** is associated with sleep quality?
2. The association between sleep quality and **alpha** diversity
3. The association between sleep quality and each **taxa**

[Sleep_analysis_beta.R](https://github.com/Cathie-Wu/DAG3_Sleeping/blob/main/Sleep_analysis_beta.R)

a supplement to Sleep_analysis.R, separated to run on the cluster

* The association between sleep quality and **beta** diversity

[Mental_Sleep_corr.R](https://github.com/Cathie-Wu/DAG3_Sleeping/blob/main/Mental_Sleep_corr.R)

- To see which mental health phenotype is correlated with sleep quality
- Tried both spearman correlation test and linear model comparison

[Sleep_Mental_analysis.R](https://github.com/Cathie-Wu/DAG3_Sleeping/blob/main/Sleep_Mental_analysis.R)

Tested the association between sleep quality and 

- **alpha** diversity
- each **taxa**

adjusted for Any depression + current mental health treatment
